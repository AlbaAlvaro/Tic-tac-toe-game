## __Tic Tac Toe game__


__*Description of the game*__

This program is developed to mimic the classical Tic Tac Toe game, it is played on a board with 9 spaces which the players can select in their turn to put their tokens. This game is played against the computer.

__*How to play this game*__
1. The players select the space in the board to put their token. Since the game is played against the computer, the choice of the player will be asked but the choice of the computer is a random space in between 1 and 9.

2. The player should try to get three "X" in a row, either in horizontal, vertical or diagonal, in total there are eight possibilities to win the game. Whenever the player or the computer gets three "X" (in the case of the player) or three "O" (in the case of the computer) in a row, it wins the game.

3. The player and the computer will continue playing until either one of them wins or the game ends up in a draw. In order to have a draw all the spaces in the board must be filled without having a winner. 

__*Things to consider while playing*__
1. It is not permited to select numbers that are out of the range from 1 to 9. If the player selects one number out of this range the program will keep asking for a valid number.

2. It is not permited to select a space in the board which has been previously occupied by another token, no matter if the token is from the player or from the computer. If ths situation happens the program will keep asking for a number to the player or to the computer until one vaid number is given.

__Have fun playing!__
